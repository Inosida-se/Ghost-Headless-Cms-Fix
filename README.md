# Ghost Headless Cms Fix
This is our fix for Ghost cms when we use it to publish content to a static jamstack site.

It probably exists a better way to accomplish this because i am new to ghost handelbars thems, but for the moment this works.


If you want to use the fix just download the project, change the web address to your static site in default.hbs, zip the folder and add it to ghost admin as a theme.
