# Ghost Headless Cms Fix

## This is our fix for Ghost cms when we use it to publish content to a static jamstack site.

It probably exists a better way to accomplish this but for the moment this works.

This is my first public repository on GitHub and I am new to handelbars ghost thems so I may have done something wrong or could have done something better if that's the case feel free to push a fix for it.

If you want to use the fix just change the web address to your static site in default.hbs, zip the folder and add it to ghost admin as a theme.
